It implements retries with exponential backoff if the message fails to send, enhancing robustness in case of temporary network errors or server issues. This function is useful in scenarios like messaging across services in a microservices architecture where network reliability can be an issue. Its inputs are: the URL as a `string` where the message should be sent, the `message` as a `string` to be delivered, and `maxRetries` as an `int` specifying the maximum number of retry attempts. The output is an `error` that can either be `nil` (on success) or contain error details after all retry attempts fail.",
