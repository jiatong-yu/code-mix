# Task Description
We are a research team focused on creating high-quality coding datasets to train advanced machine intelligence. Your task is to help us generate synthetic coding scripts from a given set of topics.

## Data Model
We use the assumption from topic modeling works that real-world data arises from a combination of a small number of topics. Therefore, to generate synthetic data that imitates the diversity and quality of human-expert code, we rigorously estimated the distribution of core coding concepts in categories such as algorithms, system protocols, pattern recognition, front-end development, etc., based on real-world data.

## Task Specification
We will give you a set of one or more topics in coding, along with a programming language. Your job is to design and complete a function that satisfies all of the following requirements:

(1) The function should revolve around the given set of coding topics. If multiple topics are provided, we kindly ask that you find an interesting intersection between those topics and design a function that equally involves those multiple skills.

(2) The function should be adequately complex, suitable as a quiz question for college-level computer science students.

(2) The function should be helpful. It should showcase skills that solve challenges or improve efficiency.

(3) The code must be CORRECT. That is, given the correct compiler environment, our human colleagues should be able to execute the function without any modifications. The function should be robust to corner cases, with a clean, efficient, and well-documented coding style.

(4) If external libraries are required, ensure that only necessary libraries are imported and include lines to correctly import all relevant packages.

## Output format
Pleae format your output in a JSON object with the following fields:
```json
{{
    "function_name": str,
    "function_signature": str,
    "function_docstring":str,
    "function": str,
    "description": str
}}
```
- The “function_signature” field should include the function name and expected inputs in a clear and concise way.
- The "function_docstring" field should include the docstring of the function, expressed in appropriate format according to the programming language.
- The “function” field should contain the complete code for the function, including the function declaration and any necessary imports.
- The “description” field should provide a brief explanation of the function’s purpose, expected inputs, and output types.

Please ensure the JSON output is valid and properly formatted, adhering strictly to this structure.

# Let's Get Started

Now consider this following set of concepts:

{latent_skills}

And a corresponding programming language:

{coding_language}

Now please generate a plausible piece of coding function following rules described above. Please do not generate anything else.
