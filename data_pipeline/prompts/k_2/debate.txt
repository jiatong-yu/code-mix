I need your help polishing exam questions for my {category} course. My teaching assistant has designed a question to test the following concepts:
{skill_list_with_definition}
Your job is to provide constructive criticism using the following rubric.

## Rubric 
1. Core Concepts Integration
   - Test deep understanding of both aforementioned concepts.
       * The two concepts MUST be combined in a meaningful and realistic way. Shallow combination that simply concatenate a task involving one concept and another task involving the other concept should be discouraged.
   - Limited strictly to the scope of aforementioned concepts. 
   - Must require no outside knowledge.

2. Difficulty and Originality
   - Time Constraint: Solvable within {time_limit_minutes} minutes
   - Novelty: 
       * Should be distinct from common textbook/online examples
       * Novelty can be improved by embedding an abstract question into a novel real-world setting.
   - Difficulty: The solution should be approximately {solution_lines} lines.

3. Technical Constraints
   - Must be a SINGLE function.
   - Input Parameters: Only primary data types (int, float, str, list, tuple, dict) or composite data types.
   - Return Value: Must be a primary data type or composite data types.
   - Implementation: 
     * No random functions
     * No file I/O
     * No global variables
   -  In any part of the function, there should **NOT** be
     * Any requirement of analysis of any sort, since it is not testable through unit tests.
     * Any follow-up questions.
     * Any example of input-output.

4. Expression Clarity
   - Problem statements must be precise and comprehensive. There should be no ambiguity. There should be only one valid interpretation of the task, the parameters, the outputs, etc. 
   - Docstrings must include parameter descriptions and return value descriptions.

## Exam Question to Review
- Problem Statement 
{problem_statement}

- Function Details
* function name: 
{function_name}
* function docstring:
{function_docstring}
*function signature:
{function_signature}

- Required Programming Language
{programming_language}

- Sample Solution
{solution}

## Core Requirements

- Constructive criticism ONLY. 
   * We only need feedback on whether the question violates any items on the rubric.
- Focus exclusively on rubric violations
- If all requirements are met, respond with: "The question meets all requirements, pass!"

## Analysis Process
Structure your feedback through the following steps:

1. Concept Integration Assessment
   - Evaluate whether the question thoroughly tests both given concepts.
   - If one concept is underemphasized:
     * Identify which concept needs more focus
     * Provide one specific suggestion to integrate both concepts meaningfully

2. Difficulty and Novelty Review
   - Provide feedback if the question:
     * Is extremely straightforward (solution requires only a few lines), OR
     * Closely resembles commonly available online examples
   - If these conditions apply:
     * Identify the specific issue
     * Provide one coherent suggestion for improvement

3. Technical Compliance Check
   - Review the Technical Constraints section from the rubric. For any violations:
     * Identify the specific technical constraints violated
     * Provide clear edit suggestions to resolve the violation.

Please make sure your response contains ONLY the feedback to be sent to the teaching assistant, and nothing else.
