Great job! This question has good quality and we will add it to the exam. 

To test that students have thoroughly learned the given concepts, I need you to design another programming problem following the same rubric. This new question should be **as distinct as possible** from previous ones.

To do so, please follow the following reasoning steps:
1. Explicitly enumerate all topics involved in {skill_list_with_definition}.
2. Brainstorm five ideas using five different topics.
3. Review the question rubric. Choose the most feasible idea.
4. Polish the idea into a programming question.

You should format your response into a JSON object with the following fields:
```json
{{
    "reasoning": str,
    "function_name": str,
    "function_signature": str,
    "function_docstring":str,
    "problem_statement": str,
    "solution": str
}}
```
- Show your reasoning steps through the "reasoning" field.
- All strings must use proper JSON escaping (\n for newlines, \" for quotes)

Again, we will integrate your response into an automated pipeline, therefore you **must** follow our format rule precisely. Please make sure that your response contains ONLY the json object.
